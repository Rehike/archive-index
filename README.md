# Welcome to the YouTube Archive Index

This repository hosts various HTML archives and recreations from YouTube. These primarily target rare logged in goodies, which cannot typically be retrieved by Wayback Machine.

The content hosted in this repository are useful for anyone who wishes to recreate the old YouTube layout, including "revival site" developers and custom frontend developers.

Due to the volatility of archives hosted elsewhere, all archives hosted outside of Wayback Machine should be mirrored in this repo and Wayback Machine.
